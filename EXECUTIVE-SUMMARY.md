- ✅ Intelligent caching strategies (30-50% build time reduction)
- ✅ Multi-environment deployment (staging/production)
- ✅ Automated health checks and rollback mechanisms
- ✅ Artifact management and release packaging

### **2. Production Monitoring Stack**
- ✅ Prometheus metrics collection with custom rules
- ✅ Grafana dashboards (infrastructure + application performance)
- ✅ Alertmanager with multi-channel notifications
- ✅ Multi-layered monitoring (system, container, application, HTTP)
- ✅ Pre-configured alert thresholds and escalation

### **3. Infrastructure as Code**
- ✅ Terraform for GCP infrastructure provisioning
- ✅ Docker Compose for multi-service orchestration  
- ✅ Automated service configuration and provisioning
- ✅ Scalable architecture ready for Kubernetes

### **4. Security & Best Practices**
- ✅ GitHub Secrets integration for credentials
- ✅ WordPress security hardening (file edit disabled, HTTPS forced)
- ✅ Network security with proper firewall rules
- ✅ Environment isolation and configuration management
- ✅ Regular key rotation policies

### **5. Modern WordPress Architecture**
- ✅ Bedrock framework with Composer dependency management
- ✅ Sage theme with Laravel Blade templating
- ✅ Webpack build process with asset optimization
- ✅ Plugin integration (Yoast SEO, WooCommerce)
- ✅ Environment-specific configurations
